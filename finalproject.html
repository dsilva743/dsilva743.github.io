            <p>The game below is a twist from the game Jeopardy! called <em>Computer Science Trivia</em>. Test your knowledge of the basics of JavaScript by scoring the highest number of points you can. The game consists of six tiles, ranging from a hundred to two hundred points per question. The more valuable the points, the more complex the question is. To start the game, click on the <strong>Start Here</strong> button after reviewing how to play. The start button will bring you to the game screen, where it will present you with six tiles to choose from. After a tile is chosen, carefully read the question, and you will have the option to pick from three different answers. Pick the correct answer and be rewarded by how much the tile is worth. Get it wrong; you lose what the tile is worth. You can always choose to go back to the main menu without losing your current points. However, if you’re not happy with your result, you can always click the <strong>Restart</strong> button. Enjoy!</p>
