I am currently majoring in computer science with a minor in Mathematics. I have very little experience with coding but previously before the starts of semester i taught myself a bit of python through <a target= "_blank" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/"<em>Codecademy</em></a>. I am excited to start my journey with computer science and where it will take me! </p>

           <p> I enjoy many things in life! However, most of my hobbies and interests revolve around the gym and the financial market. I've been exercising for many years now, and it's been a massive part of my life. I believe maintaining good health is crucial. It can help to succeed in all areas of life. I became interested in the financial market shortly after graduating high school.</p>
