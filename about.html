        <h1><em>About Dominic</em></h1>
        
        <p> My name is Dominique Silva, but people call me Dom. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am currently majoring in computer science with a minor in Mathematics. I have very little experience with coding but previously before the starts of semester i taught myself a bit of python through <a target= "_blank" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/" <em>Codecademy</em> </a>. I am excited to start my journey with computer science and where it will take me!
