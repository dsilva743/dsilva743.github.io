    <h1><em>About Dom</em></h1>
        
       <p> My name is Dominique Silva, but people call me Dom. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island. I am currently majoring in computer science with a minor in Mathematics. I have very little experience with coding but previously before the starts of semester i taught myself a bit of python through <a target= "_blank" href= "https://www.codecademy.com/"<em>Codecademy</em></a>. I am excited to start my journey with computer science and where it will take me!</p> 
    <br>
        <p> I enjoy many things in life! However, most of my hobbies and interests revolve around the gym and the financial market. I've been exercising for many years now, and it's been a massive part of my life. I believe maintaining good health is crucial. It can help to succeed in all areas of life. I became interested in the financial market shortly after graduating high school.
